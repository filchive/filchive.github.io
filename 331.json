Without the pipes items will randomly choose which way to go upon reaching a junction meaning many will go where you don't want them.\n\nThe iron pipe only has one output and multiple inputs, which are indicated by the presence or absence of a solid fill. In some versions the output is indicated by a solid fill, in others this indicates input (as is the case in the image to the right).\n\nThe direction can be changed by right-clicking the pipe with a wrench. The output direction can also be changed by redstone current. Every time it either loses or gains redstone power, it will cycle to a different output, however it will never output to a wooden pipe.\n\nThis combination of properties allows for players to accurately control its output direction from afar, via redstone wiring and/or gates . The iron pipe will pop out blocks if they try to go through the barrier that makes them go the correct direction as of 2.0. Also it will not pop out blocks if a chest, engine etc. is full, it will simply go back through the pipe.\n\nIron Pipes will occasionally bug when they have more than 2 additional pipes connected. This bug presents itself as the pipe visually showing it will allow items to pass through in a direction, but instead the items either bounce back the way they came or move off in one of the blocked directions.\n\nIron pipes can be waterproofed.\n\nBuildcraft tutorials in minutes.</span><br /></span></font></div></div>","language":"eng","scanner":"Internet Archive HTML5 Uploader 1.6.4","subject":["Minecraft","BuildCraft","Iron Transport Pipe","Tutorial","Gaming","YouTube"],"title":"Iron Transport Pipe (Tekkit/Feed The Beast) - Minecraft In Minutes","publicdate":"2019-04-28 00:34:19","uploader":"militarum.ordinatus@gmail.com","addeddate":"2019-04-28 00:34:19","curation":"[curator]validator@archive.org[/curator][date]20190428003453[/date][comment]checked for malware[/comment]","backup_location":"ia906903_2"},"files":[{"name":"Iron Transport Pipe (Tekkit Feed The Beast) - Minecraft In Minutes.mp4","size":"10563569","mtime":"1556412011","format":"MPEG4","cid":"bafykbzacec7gtnoitumeytx6ctxrgypzp5pzbsee532thjp4qxt7yvbj7iflq","deals":[{"miner":"t01782","cid":"bafyreiayhh23sralb24kg3avzzxpgpr3of7mvbpy4kxuakrprlpvxlousa"},{"miner":"t03273","cid":"bafyreiekmbpikmrjuyavmiddzmntrkp7u7xa4qvys2wwj2c6gbtlndqsbe"},{"miner":"t03274","cid":"bafyreihaet3y3hrcmlz3lfbngrzwdrm34djvnckxhshnalikutmjdyhncm"}]}]}

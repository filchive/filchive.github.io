For the specific purpose of improving children's vocabulary knowledge -- identified by the National Early Literacy Panel as a key component of literacy achievement -- these resources are systematically linked to a unique and entertaining animated digital dictionary. \n\nBut perhaps the Den's most innovative feature is its infrastructure and interface, which organizes all this content by topic, curriculum goal, and lesson plan, and makes it available, through a series of intuitive menus, so that teachers can easily present it, on interactive white boards or on other digital devices, at precisely the moment it can best support what they are teaching.</span>","scanner":"Internet Archive HTML5 Uploader 1.6.4","title":"Sirius Thinking's Digital Reading Den","uploader":"sjohnson@wallerisd.net","publicdate":"2020-07-26 18:54:08","addeddate":"2020-07-26 18:54:08","curation":"[curator]validator@archive.org[/curator][date]20200726185608[/date][comment]checked for malware[/comment]"},"files":[{"name":"Sirius Thinking's Digital Reading Den.mp4","size":"10695382","mtime":"1595789442","format":"MPEG4","cid":"bafykbzaceajggymehscribfljs57ie45rwkae2wgvs4jnkecm3c2qqnwjgugu","deals":[{"miner":"t01782","cid":"bafyreiacuf2tvgod4vb6655e4l4kpcwpcgkw57kmnra5p2skvqqs2n4rzu"}]}]}
